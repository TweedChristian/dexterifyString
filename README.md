# dexterifyString
Turns a string into a Timothy Dexter book

A dumb node script to turn any piece of text into Timothy Dexter's book format. He used no punctuation, and when people asked about it, he added a few pages with a few lines of punctuation that the readers are free to distribute as they desire.

Checks for unicode punctuation, sorry non-english speakers

Characters used: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~

## To Run
node dexterifythepunctuation.js

Then paste whatever text you want in


### Note
Has nothing to do with dexter the show
